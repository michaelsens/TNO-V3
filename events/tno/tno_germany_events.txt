Since then, we've spent the better part of two decades crushing army after army of partisans, as well as a Russian invasion. The economic collapse of the 50s made the burden of maintaining the Heer's budget a titanic struggle. Although many begged for funds to be funneled elsewhere, Hitler stood by the Wehrmacht and would not hear of it. Therefore, for the last two decades, Germany has somehow miraculously maintained its military budget, for better or worse without another major economic crisis.Militarists in both the Wehrmacht and administration continue to lobby to maintain current spending to this day. On the other side of the aisle, a coalition of reformers, civilian interests, industrialists, and even limited numbers of conservatives from the NSDAP beg us to cut the Wehrmact's budget for much needed allocation of funds elsewhere. Being in a position of power ourselves combined with Hitler's ailing health allows us to now make a change in policy, if we so choose. "

They are now more akin to the American or British scouts than the group of old, though they still honor their material traditions.\n\nWe have on our desks a couple of proposals to mold the Hitlerjugend into something more of our liking. Every year, high standing party officials review the scout's training regimates. If we so chose, we can lean on these members to influence the structure, and therefore future of the Hitlerjugend"
