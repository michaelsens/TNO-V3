  ger.1: "The Großgermanisches Reich"
  ger.1.d: "In all of history no man nor nation has ever laid their enemies low so decisively, nor governed with such evil a purpose as Adolf Hitler and the Großgermanisches Reich"
  ger.1.f: "Germany is the master of Europe. The true extent of her power stretches far beyond her borders, for no corner of Earth was left untouched by the Reich's victory or its consequences. Free to indulge in its National Socialist dogma, the Reich has spent the last decades striving for its brutal final goals - the making of an Aryan utopia and the exploitation and destruction of countless "Untermenschen" in the way. As Hitler ages, though, the troubles of this system grow impossible to ignore. Its constant, structural cruelty, paired with complacent incompetence, has fractured the very foundation of the nation. What happens when the last bonds which tie the Reich together fade away?"

  jap.1: "The Japanese Empire"
  jap.1.d: "The Atom Bomb did not, could not and would not discriminate. All were incinerated in the blast. Where women and children played, only a thin layer of black covering the ground mourned their death."
  jap.1.f: "Jealous of the Colonial Empires, the Empire of Japan sought to carve its own Imperium within East Asia. As the war against China entered a savage phase, Japan turned its gaze to the colonial holdings of the West. A decisive surprise strike at Pearl Harbour shattered their perceived racial superiority. Singapore, Manila, Batavia, and Hong Kong were only a sample of the Western failure. Despite going blow for blow across the Pacific, America was isolated. On one sunny morning over Pearl Harbour, a singular bomb was dropped that would gouge a deep scar across humanity and end the largest war ever fought. Now in 1962, Asia is only a hair's breadth away from complete Japanese domination."

  usa.1: "The United States of America"
  usa.1.d: "The United States performed admirably in the Second World War, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies."
  usa.1.f: "In late August 1945, the Official Peace Accords were signed, Ending the State of War Between the United States, Japan, and Germany. These Accords required the United States to surrender the territory of Hawaii to Japan, along with almost all of its Pacific possessions and the major ports and naval bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. As part of the agreement, the US had to pay substantial reparations and lift its oil embargo on both Germany and Japan. While many Americans viewed this as an end to the war that had needlessly claimed so many lives, an equal number were enraged that the United States had suffered its first-ever defeat in history."

  ita.1: "The Italian Empire"
  ita.1.d: "Spanning three continents, and occupying a central place in the Mediterranean Sea, the Italian Empire is a major European power, and de facto leader of the Triumvirate, a military alliance uniting the country with the Iberian Federation and the Republic of Turkey"
  ita.1.f: "As the second European economic and military power after the §rGerman Reich§!, Italy is locked with its former ally in a fight for dominance over Southern Europe. While the state propaganda depicts the Empire as stable and prosperous, the truth is far less pleasant. How did this come to pass? How did Italy become the fourth world power, only to lag behind, and become a shadow of what it aspired to be?"
