  ger.1: "The Großgermanisches Reich"
  ger.1.d: "In all of history no man nor nation has ever laid their enemies low so decisively, nor governed with such evil a purpose as Adolf Hitler and the Großgermanisches Reich"
  ger.1.f: "Germany is the master of Europe. The true extent of her power stretches far beyond her borders, for no corner of Earth was left untouched by the Reich's victory or its consequences. Free to indulge in its National Socialist dogma, the Reich has spent the last decades striving for its brutal final goals - the making of an Aryan utopia and the exploitation and destruction of countless "Untermenschen" in the way. As Hitler ages, though, the troubles of this system grow impossible to ignore. Its constant, structural cruelty, paired with complacent incompetence, has fractured the very foundation of the nation. What happens when the last bonds which tie the Reich together fade away?"

  jap.1: "The Japanese Empire"
  jap.1.d: "The Atom Bomb did not, could not and would not discriminate. All were incinerated in the blast. Where women and children played, only a thin layer of black covering the ground mourned their death."
  jap.1.f: "Jealous of the Colonial Empires, the Empire of Japan sought to carve its own Imperium within East Asia. As the war against China entered a savage phase, Japan turned its gaze to the colonial holdings of the West. A decisive surprise strike at Pearl Harbour shattered their perceived racial superiority. Singapore, Manila, Batavia, and Hong Kong were only a sample of the Western failure. Despite going blow for blow across the Pacific, America was isolated. On one sunny morning over Pearl Harbour, a singular bomb was dropped that would gouge a deep scar across humanity and end the largest war ever fought. Now in 1962, Asia is only a hair's breadth away from complete Japanese domination."

  usa.1: "The United States of America"
  usa.1.d: "The United States performed admirably in the Second World War, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies."
  usa.1.f: "In late August 1945, the Official Peace Accords were signed, Ending the State of War Between the United States, Japan, and Germany. These Accords required the United States to surrender the territory of Hawaii to Japan, along with almost all of its Pacific possessions and the major ports and naval bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. As part of the agreement, the US had to pay substantial reparations and lift its oil embargo on both Germany and Japan. While many Americans viewed this as an end to the war that had needlessly claimed so many lives, an equal number were enraged that the United States had suffered its first-ever defeat in history."

  ita.1: "The Italian Empire"
  ita.1.d: "Spanning three continents, and occupying a central place in the Mediterranean Sea, the Italian Empire is a major European power, and de facto leader of the Triumvirate, a military alliance uniting the country with the Iberian Federation and the Republic of Turkey"
  ita.1.f: "As the second European economic and military power after the §rGerman Reich§!, Italy is locked with its former ally in a fight for dominance over Southern Europe. While the state propaganda depicts the Empire as stable and prosperous, the truth is far less pleasant. How did this come to pass? How did Italy become the fourth world power, only to lag behind, and become a shadow of what it aspired to be?"
  ita.1.a: "Believe, Obey, Fight"

  bgd.1: "The SS State of Burgundy"
  bgd.1.d: "Within the shadows of Europe lies a state shrouded in darkness; a chilling vision of National Socialism realized. The SS State of Burgundy, a silent menace lurking in the West, is the brutal realization of Himmler's nightmarish ideal."
  bgd.1.f: "Carved from the territories of Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich and the German lands west of the Moselle, the Ordensstaat Burgund is the embodiment of the Burgundian System. With classic National Socialism deemed too lenient, the Burgundian System now reigns supreme, injecting its toxic mix of extreme militarism and brutal state spartanism. With a military might that rivals the world's best and work camps outnumbering homes,  the world stands in unease, aware but hesitant to confront the silent monster behind the walls of Burgundy. In this chilling vision of Himmler's dream, what future awaits the citizens held under the iron grip of the Burgundian SS?"

  amr.1: "All-Russian Government of Amur"
  amr.1.d: "After the Unholy Union forced the true sons of Russia out, some of them found their way to Harbin where we adopted the ideals of Fascism in order to more efficiently fight Bolshevism. As it was in the face of Fascism that the Unholy Union was shattered, we seem to have made a right call; and it is beneath the banner of Fascism that the Homeland will be reborn."
  amr.1.f: "Amur is controlled by the White émigré Russian Fascist Party and its notorious leader Konstantin Rodzaevsky. Originally based in Harbin, Rodzaevsky found Japanese backing after the Soviet collapsed and attempted an expedition into Russia. However, his Japanese materials quickly dried up, and other White émigré factions abandoned him and established rival groups under Mikhail Matkovsky and Tsar Mikhail II. Rodzaevsky has retreated to Amur and waits for another opportunity to strike."

  fra.1: "The French State"
  fra.1.d: "Emerging from the ashes of a defeated and humiliated Third Republic, the French State was cast in shadows as its once grand legacy crumbled under the might of the Reich."
  fra.1.f: "Emerging from World War II with its dignity shattered, the French State now endures a painful existence under restrictive treaties, economic stagnation, and a populace disillusioned with their leadership. Despite reuinification under the French State, much of France has been annexed by conquering powers, and what remained of the colonial empire has been divided among the victors. With Paris split and the ever-looming presence of the Reich, the future looks bleak for the French. Yet, in the midst of this adversity, the question remains: Will the spirit of La République ever rise again?"
  fra.1.a: "Vive la France!"

  yue.1: "The State of Guangdong"
  yue.1.d: "Out of the vast expanse of China's age-old tapestry, the State of Guangdong emerged as a modern aberration; a symbol of unchecked greed and power under the shadow of the Japanese Empire. In its neon streets, history clashes with exploitation, tradition with avarice."  
  yue.1.f: "A land artificially carved from the vastness of China, Guangdong was molded with the singular purpose of feeding the insatiable appetite of Japanese capitalism. Dominated by the electronic zaibatsus, its streets echo with the cries of the impoverished, and its alleys whisper tales of corruption. While for China, Guangdong is a bitter mark of its subjugation, and for Japan, an inconvenient experiment, for many ambitious entrepreneurs, it represents a golden land of opportunities. A place where the lines blur between corporate moguls and national leaders, and where every ambition, no matter how grand or nefarious, can find soil to root in."
