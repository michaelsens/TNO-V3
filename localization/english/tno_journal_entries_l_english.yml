  je_tno_malaya_jap: "Intervening in Malaya"
  je_tno_malaya_jap_reason: "Malaya has always been one of the more problamatic sphere members. The residents have had a mixed reception of our governance since the day we took the peninsula from British hands; some have recognized their new life under the firm guiding hand of the Japanese for the liberation that it is, while others have taken up arms against our government, naming us bandits and pillagers. The borders in the region have changed so much and so often that most cartographers have simply given up on creating accurate depictions of the region. The 25th Army's recent offensive has borne fruit in the form of the reclamation of every major port previously occupied by insurgents, yet victory is far from assured. The conflict has ebbed and flowed for decades, even without the imminent American intervention. We must take strides to ensure the Pacific remains ours, or the situation will spiral out of control and we will find ourselves without an empire."

  je_tno_phillipeen_ofn_reason: "Since the beginning of the occupation of the Philippines, only 15,000 of the 30,000 Americans garrisoned in the archipelago ever came home. The rest were to perish in the humid jungles of the islands, crushed by the overwhelming Japanese might on the day of the Kawit Massacre.\n\nSo Japan would have hoped.\n\nIn reality, the brave freedom fighters within the archipelago have not stopped fighting since MacArthur and Quezon first fled. Consisting of those fighting for the Stars and Stripes, and those fighting for a Philippines free of Japanese tyranny, the Free Philippines Republic has recently sprung up, and we may not have long before they wither and fade.\n\nIt is clear to all that the ironically named "Second Philippine Republic" will soon undergo its greatest challenge, and if we can do anything to make that challenge all the more difficult, we should. If we ever want to return to the Philippines, we will need to do everything in our power to support our fighting Filipinos. Sending arms, ammunition, and intelligence support will only worsen the conditions for our enemies, and improve the odds of an allied Philippines once more. Soon, another domino shall tumble, and all of Asia will be under our firm control. The Japanese sphere is unstable, and resistance forces threaten to destroy the Empire. If all goes well, they can potentially be our greatest allies in the East."

Consisting of those fighting for the imperialists, and those fighting for a Philippines ruled by communist tyranny. Our sphere is unstable, and resistance forces threaten to destroy the Empire. If all goes to shit, we may never return to these lands. "
