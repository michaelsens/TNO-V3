  je_tno_malaya_jap_reason: "Shonan has been one of our most problematic colonies for a considerable amount of time. Ever since we plied it off the British hands, while most have rightfully seen us as liberators, saving Malaya from exploitation at British hands, others have taken up arms against our government, the colony has been stuck in a perpetual cycle between the military government, and the rebels. While our most recent operation has reclaimed Shonan and all ports from their illegitimate government, we have information that they have stretched their hands for the Americans of all people.It's clear that the situation in South East Asia is escaping our control, and harsher measures must immediately be taken, starting with squashing Chin Peng and the UMAJF once and for all, before we turn towards the Philippines, and their own little rebel problem too.

Consisting of those fighting for the Stars and Stripes, and those fighting for a Philippines free of Japanese tyranny, the Free Philippines Republic has recently sprung up, and we may not have long before they wither and fade.\n\nIt is clear to all that the ironically named "Second Philippine Republic" will soon undergo its greatest challenge, and if we can do anything to make that challenge all the more difficult, we should. If we ever want to return to the Philippines, we will need to do everything in our power to support our fighting Filipinos. Sending arms, ammunition, and intelligence support will only worsen the conditions for our enemies, and improve the odds of an allied Philippines once more. Soon, another domino shall tumble, and all of Asia will be under our firm control. The Japanese sphere is unstable, and resistance forces threaten to destroy the Empire. If all goes well, they can potentially be our greatest allies in the East."

While on paper, it should be made up of military representatives from all around the OFN, it is basically an American-ruled military protectorate. This new administration, reluctantly led by the American general William Westmoreland, will have to compromise and do its best to clean up the mess left behind by the old Reichskommissariat. The corruption from the Hüttig regime runs deep, and if America is to capitalize on this East African puppet, much work will have to be done."
