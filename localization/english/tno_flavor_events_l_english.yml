One of the first lessons we're learning is the sheer volume of tedious, day to day, practical and administrative tasks we've taken on. We currently lack firm support from the natives, and a lot of the other locals are still tainted by their association with the old regime. Compounded by our thus far minimal capacity to properly vet and recruit, we have a limited pool to draw on. We will incorporate the Congolese we know and trust, but the brunt of the administration will have to be made up by our officers, at least at this stage of our mission"

To achieve this we'll deploy military engineers into the region and have them do the heavy lifting so that our civilian experts can safely travel and work within the area.\n\nWith the basic infrastructure operational again, we will initiate our search for ore clusters.

 tno_ru_events.3.d: "Early in the morning of our expedition, long before our geologists had awoken, bandits raided our supply caches and have stolen or destroyed significant amounts of our geological research.  This is a major setback in our expedition."
 tno_ru_events.3.f: "Although many in Russia consider the warlord period to be over, and raiding to be a way of life of the past, the recent events have proven otherwise.  The minimal security teams placed with our geologists have failed to even detect these scoundrels in the act, which has led to the firing of many of our security staff.  The incompetence of our security teams has led to the bandits escaping practically without a trace of evidence pointing to their identities, preventing us from beginning a manhunt.\n\nWith this major setback, our geologist teams are effectively starting from scratch once more.  However, this raid also provides a unique opportunity to implement a larger and more capable security force to our teams.  Despite the apparent benefits of integrating security into our geologist teams, our geologists have provided ample protest, highlighting the fact that implementing security forces into the geologist teams would surely slow down the expedition significantly."
 tno_ru_events.3.a: "We mustn't impede progress!"
 tno_ru_events.3.b: "We can't afford another setback, implement the security teams!"

 tno_ru_events.4.t: "Security Teams Prove Corrupt!"
 tno_ru_events.4.d: "The security forces we implemented into our geologist teams have stolen our research and equipment and sold it to the international black market."
 tno_ru_events.4.f: "Although many hailed the implementation of security forces into our geologist teams as a beneficial innovation, few could have predicted the unforseen consequence of corruption.  Unfortunately, we cannot remove the security forces because that would cause our cowardly geologists to feel scared for their lives from the bandits who would see our operation disrupted.\n\nAlthough it may seem the obvious choice to launch an investigation into the security forces to uncover the perpetrators, it would impede our scientists' progress so much that their research would need to effectively be stopped until the investigation is finished.  However, though unpopular, we can choose to turn a blind eye to the corruption and work towards covering it up, allowing our geologists to work unimpeded by a frankly unnecessary investigation."
 tno_ru_events.4.a: "Launch the investigation."
 tno_ru_events.4.b: "Corruption?  What corruption?"

 tno_ru_events.5.t: "Snowstorm!"
 tno_ru_events.5.d: "In the middle of the night, our teams faced a ferocious snowstorm, destroying much of our progress and injuring many of our personnel."
 tno_ru_events.5.f: "Due to the nature of the Siberian wilderness, our team has faced a fierce snowstorm, destroying a good part of our research, obliterating our equipment, and scaring many of our scientists out of their wits.\n\nExpedition leaders are now faced with an increasingly impossible task: to recover the morale of our scientists and improvise for the loss of state of the art expedition equipment and research."
 tno_ru_events.5.a: "There is nothing we can do."

 tno_ru_events.6.t: "Additional Funding Granted!"
 tno_ru_events.6.d: "Following an astonishing amount of convincing, factions within our government that are openly vocal about their support towards our expedition have convinced other members of our government to grant additional funding."
 tno_ru_events.6.f: "It is often said that politicans promise what they cannot deliver.  However, the events that occcured today in our government have proven otherwise.  Our government, impressed by our progress and the skill of our geologists, have awarded additional funding towards our endeavors in the Sakha region.\n\nExpedition leaders have already begun ordering new equipment and hiring additional highly regarded geologists to join the team.  The effects that this increase in funding will have should truly be phenomenal."
 tno_ru_events.6.a: "Truly a miracle!"

 tno_ru_events.7.t: "Sakha Expedition Failed"
 tno_ru_events.7.d: "Despite our best efforts to convince our geologists to stay and work, many of them have fled the excavation site and the remainder cannot continue the work in their place."
 tno_ru_events.7.f: "Some things were just not meant to be, it seems.  Expedition leaders had to embarrassingly report the failure of the expedition to their superiors, with painful detail of how much money had been invested and how it was all lost.  Although many expedition leaders have lost their jobs, some were fortunate enough to be re-assigned to less prestigious positions throughout our nation.\n\nMany of the geologists who fled left behind their equipment, allowing us to salvage some of our losses.  Despite the fact that our equipment has been saved, the research that we spent so much time has not.  If we are to restart the expedition, it will be with a new set of geologists, preferrably those who have not heard of this recent failed attempt."

 tno_ru_events.8.f: "The expedition has finally come to an end.  This is what the various expedition leaders had recently found so difficult to believe.  What they could only dream of while they spent sleepless nights working with their geologist crews, and other nights spent lying awake at the possibility of failure.  The expedition has finally come to an end.  The expedition leaders breathed a sigh of relief which they had not done for as long as they could remember.\n\nPerhaps they would be considered a hero for being the reason the Far East was able to pull itself from its hole that was warlordism into the modern thriving state it would soon find itself to be.  Or perhaps they would be merely a footnote in history, forgotten as their Far-Eastern state failed to stand up to those in the West.  Whatever the outcome of their exploits will be, they can finally return home to their families, to their superiors, with word of hope.  Hope not just for them, but hope for their entire nation."

They have missed you dearly," she said, brushing aside the new hole in the wall and the deafening cold that lingered in the absence of central heating. The apartment, like its occupants, bore the scars of a life defined by endurance.\n\nLater that night, shivering in the apartment's cold embrace, he reflected on the toll of his endeavors. The aches in his muscles, the pounding in his head, and the dryness of his throat were tangible reminders of the challenges faced. Yet, in the quiet moments, he clung to the belief that his work had a purpose, that his children would one day reap the rewards of the prosperity he had strived to deliver. In that weary solitude, he sought solace, yearning for the exhaustion to transform into a legacy of progress."

 tno_irk_events.3.f: ""The court hereby finds the accused guilty of all charges, and sentences them to the supreme penalty of execution by firing squad!" When these words were said, some men immediately collapsed to the floor and lost their nerve, while others remained standing in cold acceptance of their fate. In no time at all, a group of NKVD soldiers entered and began to violently pull the condemned men out of the ad-hoc courtroom and further into the depths of NKVD headquarters.\n\nEventually the group was led into a nondescript, concrete room with no windows and only a single dangling light. The NKVD soldiers ordered the prisoners against the wall, and forcefully shoved those who were too hysterical to move. Soon enough, everyone was lined up and ready."

He was suddenly helped to his feet by the strong arms of two Red Army sergeants - and forcefully directed from the room.\n\nAs he was hustled into the central vehicle in a small convoy and driven away, he could hear the radio announcing the appointment of Sergey Bessonov as General Secretary.

A staple of the peninsula is ever-shifting rulers, and the residents have been forced to suffer through the seemingly constant conflict between the communist rebels led by Chin Peng and the Japanese 25th Army's provisonal government led by Yamamoto Moichirō. Two decades of guerrilla warfare and growing pressure from the Japanese administration have left the 25th Army desperate, leading them to launch a final offensive in the hopes of destroying the rebel presence in the region once and for all.

  tno_germany_events.42.d: "After a monumental loyalty contest between us and our subjects, and the traitors to our rule now defined, we have finally defeated the traitors and re-established our rule over the Einheitspakt."
  tno_germany_events.42.f: "At the onset of our civil strife, the various subject states that we ruled over faced civil strife of their own.  Described as a 'great loyalty test' by Führer [SCOPE.sCharacter('ger_leader').GetFullNameNoFormatting], many of our former subject states managed to prolong German rule in their regions, despite rebel activity.  However, subjects like Ostland and Ukraine were not so lucky.\n\nDespite these significant setbacks, and the tremendous task of reconstruction following our civil war, we have managed to re-establish our rule over all former territories.  The thousands of German colonial families who will proudly inherit these regions have only us to thank for perpetuating their existence."
