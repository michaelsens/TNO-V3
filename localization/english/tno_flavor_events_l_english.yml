  tno_malaya_events.1.d: "In the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Pearl Harbor and our devastating defeat in the Second World War, Japan has maintained a seemingly indomitable hegemony over the Pacific Ocean, but now a chink in their armor has appeared in the form of the war-torn region of Malaya. A staple of the peninsula is ever-shifting rulers, and the residents have been forced to suffer through the seemingly constant conflict between the communist rebels led by Chin Peng and the Japanese 25th Army's provisonal government led by Yamamoto Moichirō. Two decades of guerrilla warfare and growing pressure from the Japanese administration have left the 25th Army desperate, leading them to launch a final offensive in the hopes of destroying the rebel presence in the region once and for all. In the face of the coming onslaught, Chin Peng has contacted us in hopes of aid."
  tno_malaya_events.1.f: "Despite our clear ideological differences, the opportunity that this provides is immeasurable. This is our first chance in nearly two decades to strike back against the enemy, and if the stars align Malaya may be the first domino of many that will tear down the Crested Wave piece by piece."

  tno_malaya_events.2: "The Malayan Insurgency"
  tno_malaya_events.2.d: "In the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Pearl Harbor and our triumph in the Second World War, we, the Japanese Empire, have sat securely at the top, riding the wave of our victory to ever greater heights. The lack of plausible threats to our dominion over the Pacific has given us a veneer of invincibility, but the 25th Army’s failure to put down the insurgency by the Chin Peng-led communist rebels in Malaya may very well prove to be disastrous. Yamamoto Moichirō, leader of the provisional government, has, in the face of his failures, chosen to mount a desperate offense against the rebels and in response Chin Peng has contacted the Americans for aid."
  tno_malaya_events.2.f: "We must ensure the 25th Army’s offensive is successful, for if the Americans choose to intervene, defeat would be all too possible, and the chain reaction that would could follow would be far too catastrophic."

  tno_germany_events.17.f: "Everyone had seen, of course, the politicians scattering to their homes, the military arming themselves and locking down roads, the police taking up their heaviest weapons and barricading their stations, but for an outright civil war?\n\nExpected or not, however, the war is here. Military units have focused their attention on Germania, ensuring the capital remains under military control, but elsewhere, the pretenders to the throne of the Reich have armed themselves and fighting has broken out across Germany. Speer, Heydrich, Bormann, Göring. Nobody knows which will win, but all of the people of the nation know that dark days are ahead of them."
  
  tno_germany_events.35: "Adolf Hitler Is Dead" 
  tno_germany_events.35.d: "The funeral for Adolf Hitler was possibly the largest and most extravagant in history. Thousands of Germans stood in attendance, with nearly an entire division of soldiers just for the funeral march, not to mention endless flyovers by the Luftwaffe and the constant jockeying for the best spots to show off by over a dozen military units."
  tno_germany_events.35.f: "Even stand out figures such as John F. Kennedy and a representative of Emperor Hirohito were in attendance. Heydrich, Speer, Göring and Bormann were all in attendance, and all gave their words on their leader's passing. And then they were gone. Not even half an hour after the body was lowered, four staff cars and their convoys were speeding off to parts unknown, preparing for plans no doubt only just beginning..."

  tno_germany_events.10.f: "All across Germany the SS have been putting up their noses in where it doesn't belong, causing a great deal of disruption throughout the Reich.

  tno_germany_events.11.f: "The great economic crash of the 50's put a quick stop to everything. Funding was massivly cut, making the planned expansions simply impossible. The highway has begun to decay from chronic lack of maintenance."

  tno_germany_events.12.d: "Millions of German soldiers were rewarded after our glorious victory in the Second World War. Our loyal troops oversaw the creation of the greatest empire the world has yet seen; it was therefore only fitting to reward them accordingly. Many veterans were given lands to settle, positions of power and influence, prestige and more than their share of wealth. This was easy enough to handle following the days of our great victory."
  tno_germany_events.12.f: "This has set a precedent of entitlement. Yet another generation of soldiers are retiring, and there isn't near the amount of wealth to go around; there simply hasn't been any new conquests.

  tno_germany_events.13.f: "Reactions are mixed; many conservative NSDAP members are disgusted, arguing that women's purity needs to be preserved and that the German woman's purpose is to be a caretaker. Some of the more traditional women wholeheartedly agree, seeing their place in Germany as an essential pillar of the German family. On the flip side, many younger women chafe at the thought of remaining second class citizens in their own country, and demand more freedoms and acceptance from the population at large. Many reformers, and even more than a few (silent) conservatives are in agreement and see the grievances laid out as valid. With popular opinion split and marches and rallies becoming more frenzied, the government needs to step in and offer guidance, one way or another."

  tno_germany_events.14: "Military Budget Review"
  tno_germany_events.14.d: "Although many begged for funds to be funneled elsewhere, Hitler stood by the Wehrmacht and would not hear of it. Therefore, for the last two decades, Germany has somehow miraculously maintained its military budget, for better or worse without another major economic crisis. Militarists in both the Wehrmacht and administration continue to lobby to maintain current spending to this day. On the other side of the aisle, a coalition of reformers, civilian interests, industrialists, and even limited numbers of conservatives from the NSDAP beg us to cut the Wehrmacht's budget for much needed allocation of funds elsewhere. Being in a position of power ourselves combined with Hitler's ailing health allows us to now make a change in policy, if we so choose."
  tno_germany_events.14.f: "After the Second World War, the German military bore no rival. Our military spending was second to none, as was our might! We proved the world our strength by accomplishing what many considered impossible; we retained tight control over our conquests, then expanded our empire even more by occupying the entire middle section of the dark continent! Since then, we've spent the better part of two decades crushing army after army of partisans, as well as a Russian invasion. The economic collapse of the 50s made the burden of maintaining the Heer's budget a titanic struggle."

The group is one of the few public organizations that weathered the economic crash last decade with a semblance of grace. They have always had funding, if not from the state than from fundraising they do themselves. This has allowed them to continue to operate, and has also given them some autonomy from the government."
  tno_germany_events.15.f: "The Hitlerjugend has naturally evolved; it is not the same youth group of the 1940s. After a decade of (relative) peace throughout Germany, the program began to de-militarize. They are now more akin to the American or British scouts than the group of old, though they still honor their martial traditions. We have on our desks a couple of proposals to mold the Hitlerjugend into something more of our liking. Every year, high standing party officials review the scout's training regimens. If we so choose, we can lean on these members to influence the structure, and therefore future of the Hitlerjugend."

Slave labor dominates most labor-intensive sectors of our economy, and it represents a huge portion of our GDP. The institution is old enough to contain a new generation that only knows the walls and barbed wire of the labor camps. For a while now, the slave population has been slowly but steadily rising, and it is apparent that we now need more living space for the increased number of laborers."
  tno_germany_events.16.f: "The camps are starting to overflow with people, and their living conditions are steadily declining. Although it is inconvenient, something should be done now. Living conditions aren't safe for the slaves, which makes it dangerous for the Germans that guard and employ them. The most simple option available to us is to build new labor camps, but there are also more... creative approaches we can consider."
