Following the disapperance of Nikolai Bukharin, Genrikh Yagoda, Director of the NKVD, spirited the Soviet government to the Far-Eastern city of Irkutsk."
 tno_irk_events.0.f: "From Irkutsk, the Presidium quickly lost the favor of Genrikh Yagoda and his NKVD.  Under the guise of 'the only loyal force that can save the Revolution,' Yagoda has clasped power from the Presidium and centralized it under the NKVD.\n\nYagoda's detractors in the Party, often referred to as the Party faction and led by Sergey Bessonov, allege that Yagoda is dismantling the Soviet proletarian bureaucracy to replace it with an NKVD securocracy."

 tno_irk_events.1.f: "The Soviet Union cannot allow a counterrevolutionary revolt on this scale to ever occur again.  If Russia is to ever rise from the ashes and show the Union as a stable entity, then our regional administrations must not allow these rebels to ever rise up against our government.  We need to strike at the source of the problem: #;TOOLTIP: The Incompetent and the Corrupt.#!\n\n#negative_value;TOOLTIP: A Great Purge#! is sorely needed to ensure our government stays indivisible.  Those officials that are incompetent to lead and administrate must be gathered up.

 tno_irk_events.1.1: "Begin the investigations immediately."
 tno_irk_events.1.2: "Good riddance."

 tno_irk_events.2.t: "Into the Files"
 tno_irk_events.2.d: "For the past two weeks, the special NKVD commission had been meeting in their headquarters in Irkutsk every day to lay the groundwork for investigating the more high-profile targets of Yagoda's purges.  Files were examined, evidence was reviewed, and men's very fates were to be decided upon."
 tno_irk_events.2.f: ""Now, comrades, that we are in the process of gathering enough evidence to arrest every man who has attained a Soviet political office in the past 10 years, there is still one question that we have yet to broach, and I figure now would be as good a time as any." Almost every man in the room looked to Bulanov in anticipation. "Once these men are in custody, how do you all propose they are dealt with?" Much to Bulanov's dismay, the room almost immediately fell into a deafening silence.\n\nAfter a deceptively long quiet intermixed with nervous glances and coughs, it was finally broken by a visibly irritated Yagoda. "You mean to tell me that you idiots have been meeting in this place for almost two goddamn weeks now and still haven't figured this out? What a joke.""
 tno_irk_events.2.1: "So the search begins."

 tno_irk_events.3.t: "The Irkutsk Trials"
 tno_irk_events.3.d: "As the prosecutor aggressively listed off increasingly absurd accusations, one could practically see what little hope had remained in the accused leaving their very bodies. What were once some of the highest-ranking bureaucrats in Irkutsk were now decrepit figures standing before what would become one of the most infamous trials in the city's entire history."
 tno_irk_events.3.f: ""The court hereby finds the accused guilty of all charges, and sentences them to the supreme penalty of execution by firing squad!" When these words were said, some men immediately collapsed to the floor and lost their nerve, while others remained standing in cold acceptance of their fate. In no time at all, a group of NKVD soldiers entered and began to violently pull the condemned men out of the ad-hoc courtroom and further into the depths of NKVD headquarters.\n\nEventually the group was led into a nondescript, concrete room with no windows and only a single dangling light. The NKVD soldiers ordered the prisoners against the wall, and forcefully shoved those who were too hysterical to move. Soon enough, everyone was lined up and ready."
 tno_irk_events.3.1: "Open fire!"

 tno_irk_events.4.t: "The Yagodan Succession"
 tno_irk_events.4.d: "General Secretary Genrikh Yagoda died after a major stroke a few days ago, characterized by a slow and agonizing existence until finally meeting his end via brain hemmorage.  With Yagoda dead, it is now time to select the next General Secretary."
 # too long, so scrapped. - tno_irk_events.4.f: "If only it were that simple.  Although traditionally the next General Secretary would be selected by the Supreme Soviet, the recent years have resulted in an unclear distribution of powers between the NKVD and the de jure governmental bodies of the Soviet Union.  What is made worse is the fact that the Supreme Soviet, seeking to regain its influence, has eagerly placed Alexei Kosygin as Premier, and seems more than eager to select the controversial Sergey Bessonov as General Secretary.\n\nOf course if these were normal times, there would be no problem - the Supreme Soviet's authority #italic legally#! should be the only party involved in this decision.  However, years of rule under Yagoda have left a series of loopholes in the Soviet government, giving the NKVD unprecedented control over the Supreme Soviet's actions.  Even more disturbing is that the NKVD have set their eyes on their own kind of General Secretary: Bogdan Kobulov.\n\nSo now, the question is simple.  Who will be the next General Secretary?"

 tno_irk_events.5.d: "Ever since the Party and the Presidium had managed to outmaneuver him through their installation of Bessonov as Premier, Genrikh Yagoda had known that they would, eventually, try to remove him from his position as General Secretary."
 tno_irk_events.5.f: "The early-morning meeting of the Central Committee had actually been called by Yagoda himself, intending to address a series of skirmishes along the southern border with Manchuria. However, shortly after it had commenced, he found himself the victim of intense criticism by other members for his supposed 'encouragement of friction within the socialist framework.'\n\nHaving purged many opponents himself over the years, Yagoda knew immediately that he was finished, outmaneuvered yet again. He was suddenly helped to his feet by the strong arms of two Red Army sergeants - and forcefully directed from the room.\n\nAs he was hustled into the central vehicle in a small convoy and driven away, he could hear the radio announcing the appointment of Sergey Bessonov as General Secretary. That morning, he had been General Secretary Yagoda, and now he was only Comrade Yagoda, destined for internal exile in some remote town where he could do no harm."
