  ger.1: "The Großgermanisches Reich"
  ger.1.d: "In all of history no man nor nation has ever laid their enemies low so decisively, nor governed with such evil a purpose as Adolf Hitler and the Großgermanisches Reich"
  ger.1.f: "Germany is the master of Europe. The true extent of her power stretches far beyond her borders, for no corner of Earth was left untouched by the Reich's victory or its consequences. Free to indulge in its National Socialist dogma, the Reich has spent the last decades striving for its brutal final goals - the making of an Aryan utopia and the exploitation and destruction of countless "Untermenschen" in the way. As Hitler ages, though, the troubles of this system grow impossible to ignore. Its constant, structural cruelty, paired with complacent incompetence, has fractured the very foundation of the nation. What happens when the last bonds which tie the Reich together fade away?"
  ger.1.a: "The Final Victory"

  jap.1: "Dai-Nippon Teikoku"
  jap.1.d: "The Atom Bomb did not, could not and would not discriminate. All were incinerated in the blast. Where women and children played, only a thin layer of black covering the ground mourned their death."
  jap.1.f: "Jealous of the Colonial Empires, the Empire of Japan sought to carve its own Imperium within East Asia. As the war against China entered a savage phase, Japan turned its gaze to the colonial holdings of the West. A decisive surprise strike at Pearl Harbour shattered their perceived racial superiority. Singapore, Manila, Batavia, and Hong Kong were only a sample of the Western failure. Despite going blow for blow across the Pacific, America was isolated. On one sunny morning over Pearl Harbour, a singular bomb was dropped that would gouge a deep scar across humanity and end the largest war ever fought. Now in 1962, Asia is only a hair's breadth away from complete Japanese domination."
  jap.1.a: "The Rising Sun"

  usa.1: "The United States of America"
  usa.1.d: "The United States performed admirably in the Second World War, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies."
  usa.1.f: "In late August 1945, the Official Peace Accords were signed, Ending the State of War Between the United States, Japan, and Germany. These Accords required the United States to surrender the territory of Hawaii to Japan, along with almost all of its Pacific possessions and the major ports and naval bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. As part of the agreement, the US had to pay substantial reparations and lift its oil embargo on both Germany and Japan. While many Americans viewed this as an end to the war that had needlessly claimed so many lives, an equal number were enraged that the United States had suffered its first-ever defeat in history."
  usa.1.a: "The Land of the Free"

  ita.1: "The Italian Empire"
  ita.1.d: "Spanning three continents, and occupying a central place in the Mediterranean Sea, the Italian Empire is a major European power, and de facto leader of the Triumvirate, a military alliance uniting the country with the Iberian Federation and the Republic of Turkey"
  ita.1.f: "As the second European economic and military power after the §rGerman Reich§!, Italy is locked with its former ally in a fight for dominance over Southern Europe. While the state propaganda depicts the Empire as stable and prosperous, the truth is far less pleasant. How did this come to pass? How did Italy become the fourth world power, only to lag behind, and become a shadow of what it aspired to be?"
  ita.1.a: "Believe, Obey, Fight"

  bgd.1: "The SS State of Burgundy"
  bgd.1.d: "Within the shadows of Europe lies a state shrouded in darkness; a chilling vision of National Socialism realized. The SS State of Burgundy, a silent menace lurking in the West, is the brutal realization of Himmler's nightmarish ideal."
  bgd.1.f: "Carved from the territories of Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich and the German lands west of the Moselle, the Ordensstaat Burgund is the embodiment of the Burgundian System. With classic National Socialism deemed too lenient, the Burgundian System now reigns supreme, injecting its toxic mix of extreme militarism and brutal state spartanism. With a military might that rivals the world's best and work camps outnumbering homes,  the world stands in unease, aware but hesitant to confront the silent monster behind the walls of Burgundy. In this chilling vision of Himmler's dream, what future awaits the citizens held under the iron grip of the Burgundian SS?"
  bgd.1.a: "Under The Black Sun"

  amr.1: "All-Russian Government of Amur"
  amr.1.d: "After the Unholy Union forced the true sons of Russia out, some of them found their way to Harbin where we adopted the ideals of Fascism in order to more efficiently fight Bolshevism. As it was in the face of Fascism that the Unholy Union was shattered, we seem to have made a right call; and it is beneath the banner of Fascism that the Homeland will be reborn."
  amr.1.f: "Amur is controlled by the White émigré Russian Fascist Party and its notorious leader Konstantin Rodzaevsky. Originally based in Harbin, Rodzaevsky found Japanese backing after the Soviet collapsed and attempted an expedition into Russia. However, his Japanese materials quickly dried up, and other White émigré factions abandoned him and established rival groups under Mikhail Matkovsky and Tsar Mikhail II. Rodzaevsky has retreated to Amur and waits for another opportunity to strike."
  amr.1.a: "The True Heir of Harbin"

  fra.1: "The French State"
  fra.1.d: "Emerging from the ashes of a defeated and humiliated Third Republic, the French State was cast in shadows as its once grand legacy crumbled under the might of the Reich."
  fra.1.f: "Emerging from World War II with its dignity shattered, the French State now endures a painful existence under restrictive treaties, economic stagnation, and a populace disillusioned with their leadership. Despite reuinification under the French State, much of France has been annexed by conquering powers, and what remained of the colonial empire has been divided among the victors. With Paris split and the ever-looming presence of the Reich, the future looks bleak for the French. Yet, in the midst of this adversity, the question remains: Will the spirit of La République ever rise again?"
  fra.1.a: "Vive la France!"

  yue.1: "The State of Guangdong"
  yue.1.d: "Out of the vast expanse of China's age-old tapestry, the State of Guangdong emerged as a modern aberration; a symbol of unchecked greed and power under the shadow of the Japanese Empire. In its neon streets, history clashes with exploitation, tradition with avarice."  
  yue.1.f: "A land artificially carved from the vastness of China, Guangdong was molded with the singular purpose of feeding the insatiable appetite of Japanese capitalism. Dominated by the electronic zaibatsus, its streets echo with the cries of the impoverished, and its alleys whisper tales of corruption. While for China, Guangdong is a bitter mark of its subjugation, and for Japan, an inconvenient experiment, for many ambitious entrepreneurs, it represents a golden land of opportunities. A place where the lines blur between corporate moguls and national leaders, and where every ambition, no matter how grand or nefarious, can find soil to root in."
  yue.1.a: "Silicon Dreams"

  ibe.1: "The Iberian Union"
  ibe.1.d: "Not since 1640 has Madrid and Lisbon been united underneath the Iberian Union. Yet, Iberia was a state birthed by necessity during the Second World War, uniting Spain and Portugal against the threat of German domination."
  ibe.1.f: "Even by the 1960's, the Union's coalition has began to chafe under its own weight as it developed into an economic powerhouse. With Washington's distancing itself from the peninsula, Franco's Iberia turned towards Italy and Turkey, forming the Triumvirate to dominate the Mediterranean. However, many have grown bitter over what is seen as Italian attempts at hegemony over the Mediterranean, and now, cracks have begun to appear. Overseas, discontent simmers in Guinea-Bissau, and Morocco remains a thorny rose in Franco's collection. While formally inside the Triumvirate, Iberia conducts affairs in virtual solitude. How long does this status quo continue? The Empire teeters, and the questions persist."
  ibe.1.a: "Blood and Gold"

  eng.1: "England"
  eng.1.d: "From the verdant hills of Yorkshire to the bustling streets of London, England stands as a stark reminder of a once-great Empire brought to its knees. Its navy and army, once the protectors of vast dominions, now lie decimated; its economy, a shell of its former might."
  eng.1.f: "When the war machine of the German Reich swept across Europe, even the indomitable British spirit could not withstand its fury. The United Kingdom, humbled and invaded, saw its realm splintered - Scotland and Ireland carved away, and the port of Cornwall seized. The proud lion was tamed, but not for long. England, though bruised, is not broken. Yet, there's a fire that still burns bright in the heart of every Englishman and woman - the dream to reunite, to rebuild, to retake what was unjustly seized. England might now stand solitary, but it dreams daily of a United Kingdom and a final retribution against the Reich. (See Decisions For Navy)"
  eng.1.a: "Keep Calm and Carry On"

  div.1: "The Divine Mandate of Siberia"
  div.1.d: "Gods of the North"
  div.1.f: "The disappointing truth is that we are currently witnessing the darkest of times in the history of our people, as dark those before the Light of the Message began to be spread among the Rus. But we are the light that shines in the darkness. As such we must stand above all the disgusting sinful: statesmen, soldiers, rapists, pillagers, communists and fascists, to show the people our virtue."

  bht.1: "The Republic of India"
  bht.1.d: "Amidst the tumultuous echoes of decades past, the Republic Party emerges as a beacon of hope and unity in India. Born from the visionaries who sought an alternative to the fervent interfaith rivalries and ideological clashes, the Republic Party champions a platform that centers on inclusivity, economic progress, and a commitment to the shared destiny of all citizens, regardless of religious or ethnic background."
  bht.1.f: "The challenges are daunting, but the spirit of India remains unwavering, fueled by the promise of a brighter future where the Indian people emerge from the shadows of colonialism and stride boldly into a new era of self-sufficiency and empowerment. As the heart of the subcontinent throbs with the rhythms of transformation, the world takes notes of the Republic's audacious endeavor to shape its destiny anew"
  bht.1.a: "To begin with nothing is to end with everything."
  
  osk.1: "The Siberian Black League"
  osk.1.d: "Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city of Omsk was seized by a league of ultranationalists sharing views of anti-German sentiment and revanchism. Led by the All-Russian Black League, the ultranationalist state will prepare for its final assault on the Reich, as revenge for the “First Trial” which brought the dissolution of the Soviet Union."
  osk.1.f: "During the Last Trial, each of us saw and faced hell on Earth. The Nazis razed our cities, slaughtered our families, and shattered the union we worked so hard to build. And as the world unraveled around us, we resolved to never again allow the Teuton to despoil our homes. Never again would we tremble in fear as the jackboot trampled on our soil."
  osk.1.a: "The Great Trial Awaits"

  wst.1: "The West Revolutionary Front"
  wst.1.d: "The icy winds of the north echo the tales of a once-mighty union. Despite being reduced to fragments by war and betrayal, the West Russian Revolutionary Front still stands defiant."
  wst.1.f: "The legacy of Lenin lives on in the frozen expanse of western Russia. The Germans may have rejoiced at the fall of the USSR, but the embers of resistance never truly died out. For a decade, under the unyielding frost, the Red Army prepared, uniting the oppressed and the hopeful. The West Russian War saw the Revolutionary Front pushing back against the German oppressors, their advance a testament to the indomitable spirit of the workers. Yet, betrayal from within halted their march. The treachery of the ROA and Tsarists, coupled with revolts from disillusioned factions, shattered their momentum. Now, they remain in the Arctic shadows, their once-great military might strained and their unity fractured. Yet the dream endures, and the Front's eyes remain firmly set on the rekindling of the Soviet flame."
  wst.1.a: "For the Motherland"

  hre.1: "The Holy Russian Empire"
  hre.1.d: "Amidst the chaos of the fractured Russian warlord states, the flame of religious fervor and monarchic dreams burns brightest under Regent Sergey Taboritsky. His vision of a purified Russia under the guiding light of the Tsarevich Alexei Romanov shapes every decision of the Blessed Regency."
  hre.1.f: "Where the remnants of the old Russia saw chaos and fracture, the Holy Russian Empire sees divine purpose. With Taboritsky's unyielding belief in the return of Tsarevich Alexei, the nation has purged its perceived filth, chasing the ideal of a divine Empire. But, as the clock ticks on, the immense weight of his divine purpose might just prove to be the Regent's downfall. No matter the cost, Taboritsky must unite Russia under the banner of the Blessed Regency and prepare it for Alexi's return."
  hre.1.a: "Alexi Lives!"

  chi.1: "The Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China"
  chi.1.d: "Chongqing's rubble echoed the fate of the Republic, where visions of unity and prosperity were met with the brutal realities of a world torn apart. From these ashes, a new government arose, puppeted by the Empire of Japan under the shadow of the Rising Sun. Where children once played, Japanese flags now waved, and the Yangtze River was choked by the dictates of Tokyo."
  chi.1.f: "For decades, China had been in turmoil, from the fall of the Qing Dynasty to the treacheries of warlords, to the civil war, and the invasion by Japan. The end of the Pacific War cemented the Reorganized National Government's rule, but at what cost? As the government's power waned under Japanese influence, a longing grew within the Chinese heart. The dream of true autonomy, of a China for the Chinese, persisted. Whether this dream can be realized or forever be submerged under the rising tide of the Japanese Empire is a tale yet to be told."

  brz.1: "The United States of Brazil"
  brz.1.d: "A nation with a vibrant blend of cultures and vast natural wealth, Brazil stands tall in the southern hemisphere. Once swayed by Vargas' charisma, it has now embraced democracy, albeit cautiously."
  brz.1.f: "Emerging from the tumultuous waves of World War II, Brazil navigated the treacherous currents of internal politics, with the shadow of Vargas casting a long, inescapable shadow. While its aspirations to further its democracy remained steadfast, the country faced opposition, both external and internal. As the 1960s dawned, Brazil found itself at a crossroads – between the paths of democracy and dictatorship, the melodies of peace and the drums of war. In a world dominated by powerful empires, Brazil's destiny remains uncertain, yet its spirit remains unbroken."
  brz.1.a: "Vai Brasil!"
