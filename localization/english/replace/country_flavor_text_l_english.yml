 IRK_FLAVOR_TEXT: "As the Union came crashing down from cracks both inside and from the war with Germany, NKVD Director Genrikh Yagoda bravely retreated himself and the Presidium to the Far-Eastern city of Irkutsk, well away from the horrors of the Western Front.  However, the following years were not kind to the Union.  The death of Martemyan Ryutin, and the eventual poor decisions made by the Presidium forced Genrikh Yagoda to become directly involved in the politics of the Central Government, eventually deciding to make himself General Secretary.  Now, with Irkutsk facing a full-scale mutiny from commander Valery Sablin, will Genrikh Yagoda and his NKVD be able to bring the Union to her former glory?"
 GER_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Once humbled by their failures in the Weltkrieg, Germany once more rose to prominence with the leadership of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Thanks to the failures of the Allies, WW2 has ended in complete German victory.\n\nGermany now presides over the most powerful Empire on Earth, but despite her victory, Germany's control remains tenuous at best. Will Germany return to the glory of the Second World War, or will its' hegemony continue to slowly crumble?"
 BGD_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Following his failed coup during the West Russian War, Heinrich Himmler was given northern France and Belgium as his fiefdom by Hitler, hoping it would leave him content to no longer meddle in German politics.\n\nBut what was meant to be a sinecure became a staging ground. The land of the nascent SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is clay in Himmler's hands, free for him to mold as he sees fit. And with his plans growing more audacious and destructive by the day, the "Shadow State" will soon play host to greater and greater dangers to the Reich, Europe, and eventually the world."
 FRA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "France seems engulfed in a great torpor, as the once-superpower stands forever chained to a mountain, with the German Eagle coming to eat its bloated liver every day.\n\nSlowly, change has been rearing its head. Whether towards reaction, reform, or revolution, more and more of the country's citizens have decided that a better situation is possible, and while political turmoil has increased, so has hope; it is merely blooming for now, of course, but what else is there left?"
 ENG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Few have comprehended it, nearly 20 years since it happened. The brightest light that shone across the world known as the British Empire was utterly extinguished in a matter of few short months.\n\nFrom the ashes of the old Britain rises an unstable and bickering regime which disagrees with itself and its own people on the future ahead. The sun has set on Britain, as it might have long ago were it not for her foolhardy resolution. Across the sea there lies rays of hope, but have Britain's wounds cut too deep to ever be cured?"
 ITA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Italy's recent history is one strung with an impressive sequence of victories and defeats. The minor partner in the European Axis, Italy entered the war playing second fiddle to Germany and performing disastrously in the Balkans - only to win an incredible victory in Egypt.\n\nItaly soon found itself ruling over an overstretched empire and a divided nation, the country only managing to counterbalance those strains with its newly acquired oil reserves. Furthermore, many in the country fear that Italy may fall from the ranks of the world powers just as quickly as it rose.  Will Italy be able to stop their fall from grace, or will they be forced under the foot of another Superpower?"
 IBE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "With Germany victorious in the Second World War, many expected Spain to rise alongside it. When Spain refused to bend to the will of Germany however tensions soon began to rise. The Germans finally demanded they bend to their demands to build the Dam of Gibraltar, which the Spanish finally relented to.\n\nThis led to chaos however as the construction of the dam failed, and as Germany confiscated Portugal's Africa colonies and began sabre rattling against their southern neighbors, Portugal and Spain agreed to unification to better hold off German invasion. This invasion never came however, and now the two rest uneasily with one another. Will this union succeed, or will Portugal and Spain become independent of eachother once more?"
 TUR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Republic of Turkey has undergone many triumphs and tribulations over the course of the 20th century. From the dream of secular Republicanism to the early days of the Kemalist revolution and the following years of strife. Turkey had become an Empire, through war. An Empire with a stagnating economy - and an Empire tearing itself apart at the seams by 1962.\n\nUnder President Ismet Inonu, the Republic has survived many a defeat and disaster, but that came at a cost. The people of Turkey are weary - and eager for change. How will Turkey enter this new era of world history?"
 USA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "While America joined the Second World War, support came too late to save her allies. The United States performed admirably, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies.\n\nNow, twenty years later, America stands divided. While the great American Depression is slowly ending, the American political scene sits in chaos. The government remains locked between the uneasy Republican-Democratic Coalition and the National Progressive Pact, a failing union of America's progressives, socialists, and authoritarians. With the Civil Rights movement greatly shifting the political sphere, many predict that the 60's will herald the greatest threats America has ever faced.  How will America enter this new era?"
 JAP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The sun never sets on the Japanese Empire, or at least it hasn't yet. Reigning over the single largest population of any nation on Earth, the Japanese maintain the largest military, industrial base, and navy in the world. With treaty ports in America and ownership of the Pacific, Japan has gone from a shut in nation behind the Europeans to the masters of the sea and land.\n\nAll is not well, however, as the increasingly byzantine Imperial Court constantly undermines the monarchy, and the more Japan uses China's resources, the more their grip on the colonies slip. Will Japan be able to keep its' colonies together, or will their Co-Prosperity Sphere crumble?"
 CHI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The hopefuls who lit the fuse against the Qing in Wuhan would die with the Republic just 30 years later as it was snuffed out by the Japanese in Chongqing. The new republican government over China claims to be the legitimate successor to the KMT's Republic but all up and down society know that this is not true. In reality, the ROC of 1962 is a virtual colony of the Japanese, serving to put food on Japanese tables and resources for exploitation.\n\nBut there are some still who see light where others don't, who see the potential in this situation. China has known only peace and stability since the War of Resistance and Japanese investments have kickstarted the Chinese economy. Perhaps this, paired with Gao Zongwu's planned Five Modernizations program, could propel China beyond being a mere subservient.  How will China emerge in this new and tulmutous era?"

 GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "With the triumph of the Axis over the Allied powers, a New Order has descended upon the world. In the places of Union Jack and the Hammer and Sickle now soar the Rising Sun and Swastika. A single light flickers desperately against the night in the United States; Germany celebrates the first man on the moon as Europe chafes; and Japan lines its pockets as China's slumber slowly breaks. The Mediterranean lies on a knife's edge, and what remains of Russia prepares to realize its destiny."
 REV_GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT:1 "Dissatisfied with the direction that the so-called organized government was taking, these revolutionaries have decided to take up arms to overthrow it. Will they succeed in seizing power or will they be crushed like so many forgotten revolutions of the past?"
 DECENTRALIZED_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Encroached upon by more organized powers, this country struggles to maintain their autonomy. Will they see the dawn of a new century, or will their name survive only in history books?"

 # Nonsense Countries
 GLI_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "Galicia is a small and unremarkable country populated by cathedral enthusiasts. Will Galicia regain its past glory?"
