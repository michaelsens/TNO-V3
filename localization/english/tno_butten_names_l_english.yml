We must now see to it to restore official German overlordship over the Polish region."

During the time of our civil war, the Netherlands faced a civil war of their own, eventually choosing to side with their rightful overlords over full-scale rebellion.  Seeing this action of good will between our nations, we should look to re-incorporate the Netherlands as a Reichkommissariat."
